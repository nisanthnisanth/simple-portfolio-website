# simple-portfolio-website
This is a simple portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It contains two pages: Home and Contact. The Home page introduces my profile, skills, and basic information, while the Contact page allows visitors to connect with me.

The project focuses on clean layout design, responsive structure, and modern styling using pure HTML and CSS.
